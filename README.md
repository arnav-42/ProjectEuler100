# ProjectEuler100

This repository contains solutions to the first 100 Project Euler questions as I go through them.

I use my [euler-cli tool](https://github.com/arnav-42/euler-cli) to generate each problem folder stub. For a given problem number `x`, the problem is stated in `px.md` and the code for the solution in `px.c` or `px.jl`. The problem in the `px.md` files is the HTML source from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives).
