# ProjectEuler100
This repository contains solutions to the first 100 Project Euler questions as I go through them.

For a given problem number `x`, the problem is stated in `px.md` and the code for the solution in `px.c` or `px.jl`.

The problem in the `px.md` files is the HTML source from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

> [!WARNING]
> These programs are not guaranteed to be portable.
>
> Tested on Ubuntu 22.04.3 (WSL2), GCC 11.4.0, x86_64, and 8 MB stack size.
>
> Some programs assume this stack size and may fail elsewhere.
>
> If a program segfaults, try increasing the stack limit, or refactor to use heap.
