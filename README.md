# ProjectEuler100
This repository contains solutions to the first 100 Project Euler questions as I go through them.

For a given problem number `x`, the problem is stated in `px.md` and the code for the solution in `px.c` or `px.jl`.

The problem in the `px.md` files is the HTML source from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

My motivation for doing this is to get better at Julia, C, and whatever other languages I hope to explore further in the future (Rust?), and these puzzles are an easy way to get familiar with the basics of any language.
