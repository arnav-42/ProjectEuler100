# ProjectEuler100
Julia and C (maybe more in the future) solutions to the first 100 Project Euler questions.

My motivation for doing this is twofold:
1) Even though I've solved and placed on leaderboards for the newer (and much more difficult) puzzles, I still never got around to solving the first 100. Apparently, they're supposed to teach the basics of solving these kinds of puzzles, so I hope to improve my Project Euler skills by doing them.
2) I want to get better at Julia, C, and whatever other languages I hope to explore further in the future (Rust?), and these puzzles are an easy way to get familiar with the basics of any language.
